1. apply patch in patch/ to hadoop and rebuild(sorry), so hadoop can use nativetask
2. build nativetask using: mvn package, you can find build jar and native libraries
   in target/ and target/native/target
   Or there is a prebuild nativetask binrary in prebuild/ for linux-amd-64
4. put jar hadoop-nativetask-0.1.0.jar to HADOOP_HOME/lib/
5. put native libraies lib/* to HADOOP_HOME/lib/native/Linux-amd-64/
